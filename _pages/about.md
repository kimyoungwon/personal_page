Hello and welcome! 

I am a passionate researcher with a Ph.D. in Measurement & Statistics from the University of Washington (UW) College of Education. Currently, I am pursuing my research interests as a postdoctoral fellow at the prestigious Harvard Graduate School of Education.

My primary research focus centers around advancing statistical methods for text analysis within randomized controlled trials (RCTs). I am deeply committed to pushing the boundaries of research methodologies to make comprehensive analysis and interpretation more accessible. Additionally, I am dedicated to minimizing the human coding burden in RCTs while maintaining statistical power through the development of innovative R packages tailored for text analysis.

Throughout my doctoral studies, I cultivated a deep expertise in quantitative methods, with a particular emphasis on predictive models incorporating multilevel analysis, latent variables, and social network analysis. My dissertation explored the intersection of factor analysis and machine learning algorithms, particularly exploring the performance of novel exploratory factor modeling techniques using Monte Carlo simulation.

My technical proficiency spans a wide array of software tools, including R, Python, SPSS, MPlus, Stata, SAS, SQL, and Tableau. These skills have been honed through my active involvement in various research projects and my role as a statistical consultant at UW’s CSSCR.

Beyond my methodological expertise, I am deeply passionate about educational and behavioral science research that advances equity and fosters social good. I firmly believe in the transformative power of research to drive positive change in society. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, playing soccer, and learning new things.
