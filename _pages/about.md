Welcome! 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Measurement & Statistics at University of Washington (UW) College of Education. I am also a statistical and programming consultant at the Center for Social Science Computation and Research (CSSCR) at UW. 

My focal research interest is statistical methods for social network and structural equation modelings combined with machine learning algorithms. I am skilled in multiple statistical modeling techniques including structural equation, multilevel, nonlinear, time series, and item response theory models as well as simulation and machine learning approaches. I have used many software packages including R, Python, SPSS, HLM, Stata, SAS, SQL, and Tableau.

Research Projects
------
1. Compares the relative benefits of exponential random graph models with latent space models – two different approaches for predicting the formation of a tie in a network – including missing data handling ([see the project slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jjG2msd5lHvbON4M5Z_K7eDaoxl7qJiyV_RHp9XzXYc/edit?usp=sharing))

1. Extends structural equation modeling using insights from machine/deep learning methods

1. Examines international students’ professional development and well-being and their racism and discrimination experiences

1. Investigates how to measure item process data with network analysis methods
