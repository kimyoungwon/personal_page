### Abstract
Although receiving critical feedback during learning situations can be an indicator of failure, constructive feedback can help a learner improve from that failure. Many theories have outlined various components of the feedback process, but models for constructive feedback that integrate both the interpersonal nature of the feedback process as well as the vantage point of the feedback receiver are few. To understand better how constructive feedback is perceived to leverage failure for enhanced thinking, motivational, and learning processes, we conducted a series of focus group interviews with undergraduates (_n_=38). Using grounded theory, we developed a process model to address underlying mechanisms for constructive criticism. The three main aspects of our model included that for feedback to be perceived as constructive, (a) criticism needed to be embedded in perceptions of care from a respect-worthy feedback giver; (b) the feedback message itself needed properties of being well-intentioned, targeted appropriately, and providing guidance as to how the work can be improved; and (c) uptake of the feedback, that is, responding to its guidance by changing the work, occurred in the context of the feedback receiverâ€™s emotions and motivation. Implications for theory and practice are discussed to promote the important role of failure and feedback while learning.
