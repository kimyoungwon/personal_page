### Abstract
Mental health issues are on the rise on college campuses for all students, including international students. This qualitative study explores the mental wellness of Korean international graduate students, a subgroup  that has received limited attention. We found that limited English proficiency shapes various aspects of Korean international graduate students’ well-being; self-imposed pressures negatively influence mental  wellness; self-blaming and an inability to express one’s feelings lead to further deterioration; and  students turn to physical and religious or spiritual activities to improve their mental wellness. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
