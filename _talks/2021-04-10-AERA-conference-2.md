<b> Kim, Y. </b> (2021, April).

Considering the competitive and stressful education environment, adolescent depression has drawn significant attention because their depression can negatively affect their future mental health. This study investigated the effect of perceived academic achievement and psychosocial factors on adolescent depression across five years in a nationally representative sample of 1653 Korean adolescents. A latent growth modeling revealed that 1) perceived academic achievement had initial, contemporaneous, and escalating effects on depression and 2) ego-resilience and self-esteem predicted the initial level of depression and the rate of change of depression. The relevance of the findings is discussed along with implications for research and practice.
