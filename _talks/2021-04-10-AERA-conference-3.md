Elfers, A., Plecki, M., <b> Kim, Y. </b>, & Bei, N. (2021, April). 

This study involves a longitudinal statewide analysis of factors that impact the retention and mobility of teachers of color. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to investigate year-to-year cohort-based data from 2015-16 to 2019-20, with Hispanic/Latinx teachers as the reference group. Findings indicate that full-time status is a unique predictor for teachers of color staying in the same school. Statistical analyses also revealed differences among individual racial/ethnic groups. In some years, Black teachers have statistically lower rates of staying in the same school and higher rates of exiting as compared to Hispanic/Latinx teachers. These and other findings suggest the importance of examining outcomes by individual racial and ethnic group when considering efforts to diversify the teacher workforce.
