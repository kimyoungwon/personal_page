This paper proposes network analysis modeling as a novel approach for quantifying item process data at student, item, and student-item hybrid levels. We demonstrate these methods using 30 elementary studentsâ€™ action sequence times (eight per item) on two comparable math items that differed primarily in type of verbal information presented.
