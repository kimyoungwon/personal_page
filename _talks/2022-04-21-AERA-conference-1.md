Koo, K., Kwon, J., & Kim, Y. (2022, April)

By interviewing 12 Korean international students in the United States in two virtual focus groups, this qualitative study explored Korean international students’ unique experiences, challenges, and multi-dimensional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six key themes regarding barriers to their well-being during COVID-19 were identified: emotional distress; social isolation and loneliness; academic challenges and limited academic progress; limited opportunities for career development; decreased physical health and health behaviors, and experiencing racism and racial discrimination. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed.
