Exploratory approaches for measurement modeling may be useful with large-scale survey and assessment data for which researchers have little theory to guide model selection. The present study used a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the accuracy of lasso algorithms in fitting a 3-factor model with three levels of measurement quality.
