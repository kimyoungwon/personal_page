* Assisted class management (20+ graduate students) and explained analysis and interpretation of multilevel models using R

### Course Description
-----
* This is an upper-level course in statistical methods designed for graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences. Students who take this course are from a diverse array of backgrounds, including education, business, communication, forestry, linguistics, music, nursing, medicine, sociology/social welfare, speech/hearing sciences, and public health – to name a few. The requirement for this course is that students have completed Edpsy 538/594 or equivalent regression coursework. Our goal will be to work through the major types of multilevel models this quarter; if time allows, we can engage in extensions such as crossclassified models. The estimated topic and text readings schedule is provided below; keep in mind that there
will be articles and handouts throughout the quarter to supplement text readings. Importantly, class lectures and discussions are considered part of the course content – the course is not designed to be an independent study course where you simply read a text and do assignments. Considering this, in-class participation is
required. If you think you will miss more than two classes (all things considered), I advise you to drop the course now.
